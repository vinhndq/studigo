# studigo

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

##This example represents a basic implementation of Passport.js together with the Sails.js framework.

===

###Usage

Clone it or download it, then:

	npm install

After that:

	sails lift	

===

I recently got a weird error when I lift the app. It looked like Grunt couldn't find the 'pretty-bytes' module. Anyway, I solved it by running this command:

	npm install --global pretty-bytes
